This repo will help you set a script on your raspberry pi to send an alert to your phone any time a crypto in your watch list moves.

The easiest way is to create a GMail account for use with this program, and have it send emails to your mobile phone. Each of the major phone companies have an extension where you can send an email to your phone number and it will come through as an SMS.

If using GMail, you will have to enable insecure apps; there are several articles online for how to do that.

Make sure you update the variables "id" and "id_list" with the cryptos in your watch list.
